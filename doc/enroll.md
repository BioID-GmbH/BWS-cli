Make a user (better) known to the system. Uploaded images are either used to
create a new class (new [BCID](./bcid.md)) or improve an existing class.

Example call: `enroll livedetection+`


Optional parameters:

    livedetection{+|-}   Enable or disable live detection (2+ images needed).

                         Attention: Disabling will have no effect if it was
                         enabled for the token!
