Exit interactive mode and return to the command line.

An exit code of 0 indicates that everything went well and a possible live
detection or verification succeeded. An error code of 1 means there were no
errors, but a result was negative, e.g. a failed verification. Larger exit codes
mean errors in usage or from the BWS.
