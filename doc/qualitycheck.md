Checks the quality of an image wrt. biometric compatibility.

Example call: qualitycheck issuer=BioID face.bmp

Optional parameters:
   full{+|-}            If true (default) work in full document mode, otherwise
                        token mode is used.

                        In document mode, more checks are being done.

   issuer=ICAO          The issuer of the quality check rules.

                        Probably you want to use "ICAO" (International Civil
                        Aviation Organization). Alternatively there is also
                        "BioID" for a bigger output image.
